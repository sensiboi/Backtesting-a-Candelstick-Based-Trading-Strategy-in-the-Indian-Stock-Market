This project focuses on designing and backtesting a rule-based trading strategy using candlestick patterns in the Indian equity market. The strategy uses Bullish and Bearish Engulfing patterns to generate buy and sell signals and evaluates performance using historical price data sourced from Yahoo Finance.

The backtesting results show that the standalone candlestick-based strategy delivered negative risk-adjusted returns, with a cumulative return of –18.99% and a negative Sharpe ratio. Although the strategy successfully identified some short-term price movements, it failed to perform consistently across different market conditions.

This project highlights the importance of systematic backtesting, risk analysis, and strategy validation, and demonstrates that technical patterns should be combined with additional indicators for improved trading performance.
